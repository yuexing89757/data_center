# FastAPI external read-only API

The FastAPI process is an independent protocol boundary that connects directly to the existing
Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL. It does not call or require Supabase URLs/keys, PostgREST, Auth, Studio,
providers, the Worker scheduler, Raw storage, or persistence services. Its SQL is limited to the
explicitly granted bounded `api_v1` functions. A future move to standalone PostgreSQL does not
change the API contract.

```dotenv
FASTAPI_DATABASE_URL='postgresql+psycopg://<api-login>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database>'
FASTAPI_API_KEY='<at-least-32-random-characters>'
FASTAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1
FASTAPI_PORT=8000
```

`FASTAPI_DATABASE_URL` is mandatory and identifies a dedicated login inheriting only the
`market_data_api` group role. The API never falls back to the Worker's `DATABASE_URL`. Connections
force read-only transactions and a five-second statement timeout.

Stable v1 routes are security search (100 rows), unadjusted daily bars (5,000 rows and 3,661 days),
classification members (5,000 rows), and the exact-date limit-up pool (5,000 rows). Business routes require `X-API-Key`. `/healthz` is
process-local and `/readyz` verifies a bounded database query. Prices and amounts remain decimal
strings. Errors never return SQL, internal schema names, database addresses, or credentials.

Keep the application on `127.0.0.1`. Public authentication, HTTPS/domain, reverse proxy, firewall,
rate limits, request-log retention, and API-key rotation are separate deployment decisions. See
`Standalone-PostgreSQL-FastAPI-Linux.md` for Linux gates.

`GET /api/v1/limit-up-pool?trade_date=YYYY-MM-DD&version=&limit=` returns the exact-date,
versioned mainboard limit-up pool (maximum 5,000 members). `trade_date` is the limit-up event
date. Each item contains the standard symbol, stock code, historical name effective that day,
and `free_float_market_cap_cny`, calculated exactly as that day's unadjusted closing price times
that day's free-float shares. Decimal values are strings. Rows missing a historical name, close,
or free-float shares are omitted individually and reported through total/valid/returned/omitted
counts plus grouped omission reasons; no value or date is substituted. Validation covers the whole
snapshot, then `limit` selects valid rows in ascending symbol order. `has_more` reports truncation;
v1 has no offset/cursor, so request 5,000 for the complete bounded set.
